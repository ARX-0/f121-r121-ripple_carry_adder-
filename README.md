## Introduction

The **r121** is a 2-bit ripple carry adder implemented in Verilog, constructed by instantiating a full adder module named **f121**. This adder is designed to perform binary addition on two 2-bit inputs, providing a 2-bit sum and a carry-out bit.

## Full Adder (f121) Module

The core building block of the 2-bit ripple carry adder is the **f121** full adder module. This module takes three inputs: A, B, and Cin (carry-in), and produces two outputs: Sum and Cout (carry-out). It is responsible for adding two bits along with a carry-in bit.
